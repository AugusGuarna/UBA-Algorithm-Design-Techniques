# UBA Algorithm Design Techniques (TDA)

This repository contains my personal implementations and solutions for the Algorithm Design Techniques course at the University of Buenos Aires.

### 🧠 Topics Covered
- **Dynamic Programming:** Optimization and sub-problem decomposition.
- **Greedy Algorithms:** Local optimal choices for global solutions.
- **Graph Theory:** BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and Flow Networks.
- **Backtracking:** State-space search and pruning.

### 📂 Structure
The solutions are organized by "Guías" (Problem Sets), covering theoretical and practical applications of data structures and complex algorithms.
